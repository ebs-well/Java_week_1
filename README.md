Problem 1 [4 points]: Write a program that simulates rolling a pair of dice. You can simulate rolling one die by choosing one of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 at random. The number you pick represents the number on the die after it is rolled. As pointed out in Section 2.5, the expression  (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1 does the computation to select a random integer between 1 and 6. You can assign this value to a variable to represent one of the dice that are being rolled. Do this twice and add the results together to get the total roll. Your program should report the number showing on each die as well as the total roll. For example:

The first die comes up 3

The second die comes up 5

Your total roll is 8

Problem 2 [2 points]:  Write a program that asks the user’s name, and then greets the user by name. Before outputting the user’s name, convert it to upper case letters. For example, if the user’s name is Fred, then the program should respond “Hello, FRED, nice to meet you!”.

Problem 3 [4 points]: Write a program that helps the user count their change. The program should ask how many quarters the user has, then how many dimes, then how many nickels, then how many pennies. Then the program should tell the user how much money they have, expressed in dollars.
